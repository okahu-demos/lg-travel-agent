## Run the travel agent app 
This application is an travel agent app that mocks travel related tasks like flight booking, hotel booking and checking weather in a city.
It's is a python program using Langgraph Agent framework. 
The app uses OpenAI gpt-4o model for inference.

1. Start the mock weather MCP server
  ```python weather-mcp-server.py > mcp.out 2>&1 &```
2. Verify mcp server is running
  ```cat mcp.out```
  The above command prints content of mpc.out file which should show a message `Application startup complete`
3. Run the pre-instrumented travel agent app with following command
   ```python lg-travel-agent.py```
   The application will prompt you for a travel booking task. You can enter something like `Book a flight from SFO to BOM next week. Book Marriot hotel in central mumbai. Also how't the weather going to be in Mumbai next week?`
   It should responds with successful booking of flight and hotel, as well as weather forcast.
